        <p>
            A <span> "blood moon"</span> total lunar eclipse will be visible early Tuesday morning in the United States, 
            but it's hard to tell at this point if that's a foreboding omen or a sign of providence for Election Day. 
            Either way, it's the last chance to see this celestial spectacle until 2025.
