                According to research conducted by Professor Dawn Scott, executive dean for Nottingham Trent University’s School of Animal, Rural and Environmental Sciences, cats are far more likely to chase away foxes than the other way around. <span> “Cats nearly always win,”</span> she says.

                Yet the fox remains something of an outcast in the popular imagination, characterised in children’s fiction as nasty and cunning, like the Foxy Whiskered Gentleman in Beatrix Potter’s story, who plots to cook Jemima Puddle-Duck. They’re “heavily villainised”, says Scott, and that has shaped deep-seated views of an animal often incorrectly thought of as vermin – a classification it has never received.
